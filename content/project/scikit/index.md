Deep Learning Course Project;<br>
Developed a combined framework integrating SimVP for video frame prediction and U-Net for semantic segmentation to generate object masks in predicted frames;<br>
Experimented with a synthetic 3D dataset, conducting training and evaluation using metrics such as MSE, IoU, and SSIM, optimizing the model for video dynamics and pixel-level segmentation;<br>
Achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.272 on a hidden dataset, demonstrating effective object segmentation and prediction accuracy;<br>
