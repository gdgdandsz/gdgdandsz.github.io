Supervised by Prof. Alex Ruthmann and Prof. Guangyu Xia, NYUSH<br>
Funded by NYU Deanâ€™s Undergraduate Research project; aimed to transform essential elements of body movements into musical elements to enhance the experience of physical rehabilitation training for patients.<br>
Established a CNN for deep music analogy on PyTorch, and applied Cascade Classifier for facial detection on OpenCV; extracted rhythm using VisBeat library<br>
Generated music pieces with different rhythms, chords, and volumes according to the recorded gestures and angle positions bridging the concept of motion capture with music generation through socket communication.<br>
