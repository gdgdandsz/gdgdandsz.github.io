Independent Study, Supervised by Prof. Roberto Fernandez, NYUSH<br>
Conducted an in-depth study of Bayesian Statistics, focusing on fundamental models such as the Binomial Model, Poisson Model, and Normal Model.<br>
Investigated advanced computational techniques, including Monte Carlo Approximation and the Gibbs Sampler, to estimate posterior distributions and analyze convergence properties.<br>
Authored detailed notes summarizing the theoretical foundations, practical applications, and computational implementations, providing a comprehensive reference for future research.<br>
