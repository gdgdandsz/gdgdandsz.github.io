Summer Intern, Supervised by Prof. Hongyu Zhao, Yale.
Conducted comprehensive literature review on genetics statistics, causal inference, and large language models (LLMs) applications in genetic research.
Utilized PolyFun[PolyFun](https://medium.com/@yiruzhou19/leveraging-polyfun-for-multi-functional-annotation-analysis-a69c8b6d5cf1), a statistical method that integrates multiple functional annotations (e.g., chromatin accessibility, histone modifications) to quantify the impact of each annotation on identifying causal genes in PTSD studies.
Implemented workflows to evaluate how the combined effect of annotations can improve the statistical power in detecting disease-relevant genes.
