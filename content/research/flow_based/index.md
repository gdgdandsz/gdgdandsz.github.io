Supervised by Prof. Zhiyao Duan, University of Rochester.
Explored various flow-based models, including Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF), Flow Matching, and Conditional Flow Matching, emphasizing their theoretical foundations and connections.
Analyzed the connections between Flow Matching and Optimal Transport, documenting the latest developments and creating visualizations to illustrate complex theoretical concepts.
Implemented and replicated toy models to validate theoretical insights and demonstrate practical applications in flow-based modeling.
Authored comprehensive notes detailing advanced techniques like Rectified Flow and Diffusion Models, as well as the integration of Optimal Transport with flow matching to achieve state-of-the-art results.
